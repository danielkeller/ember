# Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.

# Licensing

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in `maia` by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed (under [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/danielkeller/maia/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE) and the [MIT License](https://github.com/danielkeller/maia/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT)), without any additional terms or conditions.
